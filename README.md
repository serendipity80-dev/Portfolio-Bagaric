# Portfolio Bagaric Ljiljana

---

My portfolio where I presented some of my projects. For my portfolio I used grid as a layout. My projects are dynamically displayed by getting local data and set up a filter buttons for each category using javascript. I also used bootstrap for the contact page.

The technologies I used:
HTML5 Bootstrap CSS JavaScript

I also used a third party app to submit the form:[Formcarry](https://formcarry.com "Formcarry Home")
